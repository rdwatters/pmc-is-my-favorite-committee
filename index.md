# Digital Update for PMC
**Date: 2017-06-03**

## <https://pmc-is-my-favorite-committee.netlify.com/>

## Overview of New Editorial Direction

* Introduced to 3 membership committees&mdash;RFEC, NIPC, PMC&mdash;in 2016
* Production of articles kicked off for all committees in Q3 and Q4

## Stats

* 4 Committees: PMC, NIPC, RFEC, PHC
* The CAP Personalized Health Care Committee (PHC) is the newest committee to be added to the new editorial model as of May 2017; first meeting in June 2017
* Total published articles by the end of June 2017: *13*
    * 4 new articles being published by NIPC on June 16th
    * Most recent article: ["Dr. Allen on the Case for Patient-Centered Pathology"](http://www.cap.org/web/home/resources/case-for-patient-centered-pathology)
    * Next up: Monday, June 5th, article Dr. Richey (RFEC) on "Resident Burnout" (first RFEC article)
* **December 2016** PMC's first article, "Simple Methods for Demonstrating Your Value as a Pathologist"
    * Pageviews: 500; this may seem low, but consider:
        * The public-facing website for cap.org (i.e., "PWS") has a few thousand pages of content
        * Our target audience is only 18k people
        * Some pages have only had a couple dozen pageviews since the beginning of 2017
    * Time on page: ≈3 Minutes (33% more than the entire cap.org average);
        * Bodes well for content: average reading speed is ≈300 words/min
* SEO Improvements
    * CAP.org Member-generated articles are, as a whole, faring better in SERPs (search engine results pages)
        * **NIPC:** *"career resources pathologists"*,*"new in practice pathologists"*,*"pathology career resources"*, *"career resources pathology"*,*"transition to pathology fellowship"* = ***First page of Google SERPs***
        * **PMC Article:** *"pathology demonstrating value"*, *"pathologist value"*, *"pathology practice management"* = ***First page of Google SERPs***

## Improvements

### Process

* The [CAP.org Membership Content editorial calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PY7stz-MtTOis6k6Qnzm9dcCA70G5golj9gFXeXX-oI/edit?usp=sharing), the single source of truth for all publishing dates and information
    * Coordinated with Julie McDowell, Social Media Manager
        * Now better coordination with social media to promote traffic
    * New Calendar being developed with Communications beginning July 2017 to better

### Technology

* Informational website optimization project (IWO), begins July 2017
    * Reduced time to publish
    * New editorial workflows
    * Better performance for end users (this helps in so many ways)

## Opportunities

* Second article for PMC, "Descriptions of Practice Management Areas" fell into the maelstrom of other articles because of delayed in Q1, 2017
    * **Good news**
        * Scrapped previous versions of the article in favor of a new piece, compiled from old notes, meetings, CAP texts, and phone calls (thanks, Dr. Ruby)
        * Rough draft of an article will be sent out review to original author group (Himchak, Hegner, Sconyers, Ruby) between Monday, June 5th and Friday June 9th (conference)
        * Current publish date is (tentatively) July 14th
            * After holiday
            * Allows NIPC articles to rotate off "Featured Articles" section of members.cap.org

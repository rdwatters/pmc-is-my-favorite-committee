## Overview of New Editorial Direction

* Introduced to 3 membership committees, including PMC, in 2016
* Production of articles kicked off in Q3 and Q4

## Stats for End of June 2016

* 4 Committees: PMC, NIPC, RFEC, PHC
* PHC newest committee to be added to the new editorial model

    * 4 new articles being published by NIPC on June 16th
    * Newest article will be published Monday; Richey on "Resident Burnout"
* "Simple Methods for Demonstrating Your Value as a Pathologist"
    * Pageviews: 500; this may seem low, but consider:
        * The public-facing website for cap.org (i.e., "PWS") has a few thousand pages of content
        * Our target audience is only 18k people
        * Some pages have only had a couple dozen pageviews since the beginning of 2017
    * Time on page: ≈3 Minutes (33% more than the entire cap.org average);
        * Bodes well for content: average reading speed is ≈300 words/min
* SEO Improvements
    * CAP.org Member-generated articles are, as a whole, faring better in SERPs (search engine results pages)
        *
        * **PMC Article:** "pathology demonstrating value"*, *"pathologist value"*, *"pathology practice management"* = all on first page of Google SERPs (search engine results pages)
